		<h2>About Anupreet Sehgal</h2>
		<p>
    Anupreet Sehgal is one of the most special people in my life; he is my father, hero, and role model. He even treats me like one of his friends and removes that barrier of son and father he always helps me when I am in a tough spot by either fixing it for me or making me learn how to do it and gives me advice on it. My dad is also a pro in technology and is highly respected in our neighborhood and in his office because of his gentleness and politeness. He is a very intelligent man and always helps others in their problems. My dad is such a good person that he even helps needy people even if they are strangers. He is the boss of the family and gives great advice and instruction to every family member; he solves problems for the neighbors. He also often visits my school and discusses my performance with my teachers. Dad I love you keep doing what you’re doing you’re the best father I could ever want or ask for and I try every day to be just like the person you are today.  I LOVE YOU!!!!!😍😘

Happy Father's Day!
